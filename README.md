# aws-serverless-movie-api
This project demonstrates how to build a serverless API using AWS services such as Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB. The API retrieves movie information stored in a DynamoDB table and provides it via a RESTful endpoint. This architecture leverages the scalability and cost-effectiveness of serverless computing.
